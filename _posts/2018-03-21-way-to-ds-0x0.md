### Pick a Systematic Process Applied For Predictive Problems

## 5-step process:
1. Define the Problem: formalize question using Task(T), Experience(E) and Performance(P): if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E
2. Prepare Data: 
    1), collect data; anything can be INPUT, OUTPUT -> raw data
    2), process data; raw data as INPUT, OUTPUT -> structured data
    3), transform data; structured data as INPUT, OUTPUT -> featured data with feature Scaling, decomposition and aggregation
3. Spot Check Algorithms
    run a bunch of standard algorithms to spot out which algorithms are better to focus on and more related to the problem we defined ahead. Normally we do train/test validation, cross validation via 5 or 10 Folds.
4. Improve Results
    1) Algorithm Tuning, 2) Extreme Feature Engineering
5. Present Results: Conclusions (Why+Question+Answer)

### Pick a tool

1. Orange/Weka software for basic operations
2. Programming using python to do more


### Do more and more real practices.

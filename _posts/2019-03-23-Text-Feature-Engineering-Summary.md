### Feature Engineering Methods for Text Data

Text data is in forms of words, phrases, sentences and documents. A set of documents is __corpus__ as we know.

1. Pre-processing
To clean up text data, here are some points:
    1.1. Removing tags: like HTML tags <br>
    1.2. Removing accented characters: like Ã© to e <br>
    1.3. Removing special characters: punctual tokens <br>
    1.4. Stemming and lemmatization <br>
    1.5. Removing stopwords <br>

2. Processing
To convert text to number, here are some points:
    2.1. Count Based: Bag-of-Word (N-Gram) <br>
    2.2. Word Frequence Based: TF-IDF <br>
    2.3. Word embedding: word2vect <br>
    2.4. Topic Modelling: LDA

Today's #1 trending repo on GitHub is [System Prompts and Models of AI Tools](https://github.com/x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools), an extensive collection of over 30,000 lines of system prompts, internal tools, and AI model configurations from popular coding assistants and AI development platforms.

## What's Inside This Repository?

This repository serves as a treasure trove for understanding how modern AI coding assistants work under the hood. It contains leaked or reverse-engineered system prompts and tool definitions from major platforms including:

- **Cursor** - The popular VS Code-based AI coding assistant
- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's coding-focused AI
- **Devin AI** - The autonomous AI software engineer
- **Replit** - Cloud-based IDE with AI capabilities
- **VSCode Agent** - Microsoft's AI coding integration
- **Windsurf** - AI-powered code completion tool
- **Perplexity** - AI search and coding assistant
- **Manus** - Multi-agent AI platform
- **Trae** - AI development environment
- **Leap.new** - AI-powered development platform
- And many more including **Augment Code**, **Cluely**, **CodeBuddy**, **Comet**, **Junie**, **Kiro**, **Lovable**, **NotionAI**, **Orchids.app**, **Poke**, **Qoder**, **Same.dev**, **Traycer AI**, **Warp.dev**, **Xcode**, **Z.ai Code**, **dia**, and **v0**

## Why This Matters

Understanding system prompts is crucial for several reasons:

### 1. **Security Awareness**
The repository includes a security notice warning AI startups to protect their system prompts, as exposed prompts can become targets for hackers. This highlights the importance of securing proprietary AI instructions.

### 2. **Educational Value**
For developers building AI agents, studying these prompts provides insights into effective prompt engineering patterns, tool calling strategies, and context management techniques used by leading platforms.

### 3. **Transparency**
Having access to these internal configurations promotes transparency in the AI ecosystem, allowing researchers and developers to understand how different platforms approach similar problems.

## Structure and Organization

The repository is meticulously organized with dedicated folders for each platform, making it easy to explore specific implementations. Each folder typically contains:
- System prompt definitions
- Tool specifications and APIs
- Model configuration parameters
- Context engineering strategies

## Ethical Considerations

While this repository provides valuable educational insights, it's important to note that many of these prompts may have been obtained without explicit authorization from the original companies. The repository serves as both a learning resource and a cautionary tale about the importance of securing AI system configurations.

The maintainer also offers a security service called [ZeroLeaks](https://zeroleaks.ai/) that helps AI startups identify and secure potential leaks in their system instructions and model configurations.

## Getting Started

To explore this repository:
1. Clone it locally: `git clone https://github.com/x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools.git`
2. Browse the directory structure to find prompts for your platform of interest
3. Study the patterns and techniques used by different implementations

This repository is particularly valuable for AI researchers, prompt engineers, and developers building custom AI agents who want to understand industry best practices and common pitfalls in system prompt design.
